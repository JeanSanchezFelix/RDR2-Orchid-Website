# Orchids of Red Dead Redemption 2

Welcome to the README file for my first ever created website, which focuses on the orchids found in the game Red Dead Redemption 2. In this project, I explore the beautiful orchids that exist in real life, providing a photo, description, and information about their endangerment status. I have also included additional tabs for more information about orchids in general and references used in this project.

## Motivation

I created this website as a way to combine my passion for this game and nature. Red Dead Redemption 2 features a vast and immersive world, and I was captivated by the detailed depiction of various plants, including orchids. Through this project, I wanted to learn more about orchids, their real-life counterparts, and their conservation status.
